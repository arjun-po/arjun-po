👋 About Me
Hello! I'm a Computer Engineering Diploma Holder with a strong passion for software quality and user experience. While I’ve enjoyed building websites and apps, I’ve recently developed a deep interest in Software Testing (QA) — understanding how products fail, and how to make them more reliable and user-friendly.

I'm actively learning manual testing, including writing test cases, reporting bugs, and validating key features. My goal is to begin my journey as a QA Intern, grow with real-world experience, and become a dependable part of a quality-driven tech team.


🧠 Currently Exploring:
🧪 Software Testing – Manual Testing, Test Case Design, Bug Reporting


🌱 Goals:
Start my career as a QA Intern

Gain hands-on experience in testing real software

Join a collaborative tech team focused on software quality

Keep improving my debugging, test design, and analysis skills


🚀 "I may be a beginner — but I'm learning, testing, and improving every day!"
