## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm a final-year Computer Engineering Diploma student, passionate about building real-world tech projects and ensuring their quality through proper testing. While I love creating apps and websites, I’ve recently developed a strong interest in software testing (QA) — understanding how things break and how to make them better.

I’m actively learning manual testing practices like writing test cases, reporting bugs, and validating functionality. At the same time, I’m improving my skills in development to become a well-rounded software professional.

🧠 Currently Exploring:

🌐 Web Development – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

📱 Mobile Development – Flutter (Beginner)

🧪 Software Testing – Manual Testing, Test Case Design, Bug Reporting

🧠 DSA – Learning Java and Data Structures

💡 AI – Built an object detection app using Google ML Kit

🔧 Backend – PHP (Beginner), Basic SQL

🌱 Goals:
Get my first job as a Junior QA Engineer or Developer

Build practical tech projects that solve real-world problems

Learn full-stack development and testing methodologies in depth

Contribute to a collaborative, quality-driven tech team

Keep improving my debugging and test analysis skills

🚀 "I'm not an expert yet—but I’m learning, building, and growing every day!"
